# MIP Manager

This tool was made for managing mip map textures dumped by [Dolphin Emulator](https://dolphin-emu.org/) for texture pack creation and management. This is based on a tool made by [Phillip Stephens (Antidote)](https://github.com/Antidote) that was originally written in Python. The original program is provided in the `src/` folder _*(`Move Mips.py`)_.

## Usage

Place the executable in the desired texture dump folder and run directly or through the console.

## Features

- Moves all mip map textures

- Outputs a full list of every mi file and its name when finished

- Highlights portions of file names in output that determine if it is a mip

- Provides a total file count for all mips found and moved
